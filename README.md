Simplified version of Adam Vogel and Dan Jurafsky. "Learning to follow navigational directions" https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/spatial-acl2010.pdf

Major simplifications:
1) Random action selection instead of Boltzmann exploration
2) No allocentric or egocentric features in the feature vector
3) Using some number of iterations instead of looking at theta convergence
