ehm right
you start at the caravan park
right
ehm if you go down about three inches down uh-huh
and then across about two and go back up in
no
right okay
we're going
see the old mill can you find the old mill on your map
it's an old mill
okay right
you go to the old mill
there's no picket fence here eh
well
no
i go down and then i turn right n-- no then i turn left and then i go back up past the old mill so it's like a curve it's like a curve going up down and then up again past the old
have you got is old mill quite near the caravan park
mm
and ha-- have you to go have you to go there like in you've not you've not to pass the ca-- you've not to pass that fence
so then
right i see
so is that the idea of this then so you you're going straight to where i am instead of going round the picket fence
if i say if i say that you've to go to the old mill first
mmhmm
hmm
but is the idea is the idea so that you don't go there to the picket fence if i'm going to the old mill first
right okay
mmhmm
the old mill
right
can you can you s-- s-- can you s-- well can you see the abandoned cottage
uh-huh
so if mm
so if you go to the old mill and then y--
uh-huh
mmhmm mmhmm mmhmm
so you're going to your right old now going out to your right and then eh straight up to the round the abandoned cottage right
mmhmm
is the point so that you it's not so that you d-- you avoid that that fence or have you got to go by that fence
right you have right
uh-huh
no
you ma-- you're actually meant to over the mill
uh-huh
as in on the left-hand side of it you know what i mean like going up round it on the map
uh-huh
so is this
right
it's on the it's on the far left isn't it
uh-huh
uh-huh that's fine
so if you you're going to the old mill
mmhmm
uh-huh
yeah but on my map it's not got that it's eh
you're going in a sort of curve to the bottom of the map then round the old mill
uh-huh
no
you don't actually go under the old mill you go like round it
like
see the side where the steps are
like
that's how you go just just go round the top
no the other side
uh-huh
where where the steps are and round the r-- on top of the roof and then you go round to your right
just keep going right then straight up round the abandoned cottage
no
well o-- on the route on this map is you've to go down
uh-huh
no
the shape of a like an oval shape from the caravan park you start just above the caravans
right
ma-- make mark across above the caravans go round like just like an oval like half an until you come to sort of top of the old mill like say the
the corner of the roof
then uh-huh
do a curve right up to your right
sort of d-- gradual curve to your right
eh
see where the fenced meadow is
uh-huh
well
see where the fenced meadow is at the bottom of your page
when you go right from the old mill go right and just where eh that you start you come to the beginning of that drawing on the right go straight up round the abandoned cottage
no
you go you're above the fenced meadow the the route is actually above that
okay it's basi-- if
see if you go over the old mill
right you're o-- you're o-- eh over the the roof right
and you're going make a gradual slope to your right
okay
no quite just sort a wee gradual one
towards fe-- where the hell's the forest
no
there there's no forest
well
you don't want to go to the fenced meadow anyway
i'm just telling i'm giving you a g-- i because it's like
you stop you stop going right above the fenced meadow where you come to that drawing
no
no
right
you're at the old mill go back to the old mill
okay
right
see the roof
go over the roof
keep going right
'til about th--
right okay
let's start again in different terms
see about three quarters of the way to your right in the page
stop right when you've go-- drawn your line from the old mill and then just go straight up and make a line round the abandoned like a circle round the abandoned cottage
curve round the abandoned cottage and round the roof
uh-huh
and s--
well
it's meant to be a sort of continuous curve is it not
oh right i see
right
well see where the abandoned cottage is now right you're at the roof of the abandoned co--
right
go down say about forty-five degrees on a sort of angle
down
see where the fenced meadow is besi-- on the left-hand side of the r-- uh-huh the left-hand side of your page
about halfway up
is it not
mmhmm
i've got two here
right ehm
mmhmm
and no forest
no
right
have you
right okay
may-- aye maybe that's what it is then
oh right
see where the see where your caravan park is then
have you got something below it
have you got a ca-- have you got a fence below it
well
did you go round it
di--
well
see the caravan park
i-- is there is there a picket fence underneath it
well
could you make a line go round it and then c--
is it bet-- is it like down and then the old mill's above from it
so can you not go round the picket fence and round the old mill do you not have to go round the picket fence no
uh-huh
uh-huh
well
do you not have to go round it
it's it's not a picket fence here so the route must go round the picket fence surely
well
maybe it is okay as long as you're on the picket fence then i don't know
right right you went by the abandoned cottage right
right you're above the chimney
and if you start going dow-- in an angle about forty-five degrees down
to the to where the bottom of the abandoned cottage
right
'til oh right so
you said you where are you now
right uh-huh
but wh-- is there anything on your map beside that then on your left-hand side
well
can you make sort of like right if you make a sort of
if you make a sort of like a a forty-five degree angle right for about a couple of inches or something and then you start making a circle you know what if you know what i mean if you've got does a sort of angle then sort of curve round
have you got a west lake
well can you can you make a sort of curve then if after your angle sort of like towards the west lake
uh-huh
sort of like you've gone
mm
it's about halfway up the page that's wh-- uh-huh it's just about about halfway up the page
so if you s-- imagine a fenced meadow in the middle of the page
and you sort of make a circle round up towards the west lake you go up to the west lake and then
mmhmm
no
you go ri-- you make a a ci-- you make a line up go up
right
to the ti-- 'til you reach the west lake
see the curve in the at the bottom of the west lake
that sort of can you see a round curve
go to the the eh furthest point of that like in your left-hand side right about the bottom of that curve
and start curving round it
ti-- if you if you s--
can you see a trig point
no
ehm
right have you got the eh the west lake
so make a curve round the bottom of that curve right so just follow that curve
around west lake up to the just up to the point you know
can you see on the west lake where it goes sort of straight
no oh
right
just just just go round
right
until about
trying to think wh--
see right can you not
see if there's a circle at the bottom know how you've just gone round it
and you keep going up 'til about it's a kind of sh-- there's kind of angle
oh this is really hard
see where the farmed land is at the top
uh-huh it's at the right-hand side
right well
so are you at the bottom left-hand
right
and and you can cu-- you curve round the bottom and keep going up that curve just curve round that
no
se-- can you see a monument
yeah
uh-huh that's what i mean
and is the nuclear test site above it
no
right
have you got
is it
up from its furthest point
right
so you want want you want to go round the golf course then i think
right
i take it they're the same shape on the maps then
right
right
west lake isn't exac--
you don't want to cross the lake
you don't want to go to the farmed land
i just asked if i had if you had farmed land
no
uh-huh
right
you you you curve round
right
see west lake you can see the curves can't you round west lake
on the left-hand side right
right
you've just come up from the abandoned cottage right
and you've gone straight up
to the bottom of west lake
see directly underneath it where it says west lake
see the see see whe-- west lake see where the "e" is
directly under that you can then you see a curve going round to your right it's like a sort of bottom of a circle or something it's quite it's quite rounded
mmhmm
mmhmm
oh god i forgot about that
right
you go down and just start
right
see where the "e" in lake is right and
go down to the bottom of that start tracing around that then towards your right
uh-huh
oh sorry have you been going right up the other side
no
we're going right
right
you've got you right you went to the abandoned cottage and you did a sort of circle
uh-huh you are
and you're going round
yeah
round the curve and then up
round that curve and then up
and you don't have a trig point
see ehm where you've curved up from west lake do you know where i'm talking about see how there's a kind of sharp turn to the left
in west lake
uh-huh
and then you go down there's a kind of a bit you go straight down and then you go back up again
if you can follow this
right so you've went round the corner right
start again
and see wh-- how i just said how it goes straight up and it goes down and it goes up
see that bit that goes up
the first time
sort of sharp bit
right
stop following the curve at the bottom of that
okay
and see when you get to that
do an angle follow that
see that sort of straight angle
do a straight line going to your towards your your right down to the left-hand side you're going down
right okay
if d-- if you think of a compass so if it would be your ehm eh southwest
no
you wouldn't be in the lake you shouldn't
mmhmm
you haven't gone right round the lake have you
uh-huh
uh-huh
the bottom of that
well
then you're going t--
oh east sorry
sorry right uh-huh right
god it's my directions
you go east southeast down
straight
have you do you should have a monument
right great
right
go down there straight and go right and
do you see where the monument is
do a straight line to the monument
to the bottom of the monument and curve round the monument just now
and then you're starting to go up uh-huh go up a bit
eh it's just it's almost straight up from the monument a few in-- a few inches
i don't know where your golf course is
it's just it's about an inch under the east lake at the bottom of east lake
so you've got the monument
just go st-- down straight line down underneath the monument
and then up t-- curve up
eh go left for a couple of for about an inch or something
okay
eh oh about an inch up from the monu-- just just curve sort of curve round a circle sort of
uh-huh
you want to stay on the left-hand side uh-huh
you want to stay on the left-hand side
right
you go round the monument
and s-- go left
go left
and then go straight up towards the east lake
uh-huh
just go straight up to east lake when you've curved round the monument and where the golf course'll be sort of curve
nuclear test site is
to the left-hand side of east lake like the very far end of east lake
but that's where you're meant to end up underneath east lake
uh-huh
uh-huh
no
that's the finish
do you know where the farmed land is
yeah
you go well your finish point's just beside east lake
so if you went have you went round curved round the monument
are you sure right that you've went up oh right and you've we-- you've gone up towards east lake and then turned then went to your right just followed the curve round east lake t--
see where east lake is
are you talking about the very bottom
you talking about the bottom right
you've just reached there
but you're supposed to curve underneath there to about halfway you're meant to like sort of draw a line following that line to about halfway and then go down round past the monument past your golf course i think as well
maybe you go round your golf course
right
no no
that's the finish
right see at the the bottom left of east lake
that's finish point
eh well
just a centimetre past it right to your left
right that's finish point so
so i take it that must be another s-- they must be between each other
the line should be between that then
it's the golf course right it's underneath east lake and it's eh northwest from the monument
so have you gone round it as in have you gone round it on the right-hand side
uh-huh
you've you come to the monument and you go round it the golf course trace
mmhmm mmhmm
have you got a nuclear test site
it is
but it's on the right-hand side on the right-hand but exactly under the right-hand side of east lake
so you must like have to trace round it then
i take it on the right-hand side so it's between it
eh
so then you just just just just trace underneath the curve to the finish
uh-huh yeah
right that's the ve-- the finish point
of east lake have you traced under the east lake
i think so
