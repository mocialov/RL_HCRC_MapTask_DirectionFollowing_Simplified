well
you'll have to go right round it on the left-hand side
right
of the old mill uh-huh
and get to the top of the roof
right
you're you're at the roof right so go up and there's about mm
see the fenced meadow

right
uh-huh uh-huh
where the fence is right on the left-hand s--
so
uh-huh
and see where the o-- bi-- that but see where the old mill is
see you come up draw a line between that and that where that fenced meadow where you've just made a mark right draw a straight line
yeah
well
i don't have a forest so ehm
i presume it must be
so you must go round that
right
see where you are then
draw a straight line going up
right
and curve round the abandoned cottage right above it
right so
and curve right up round above the
to to your
mmhmm you will be yeah
go round the right side
and then right round t-- to to your left curve round to your left and you're going up above the abandoned cottage
no
go right
right
see where the forest is right
you're go-- you're curving right up and keep curving right round the side of the right-hand side sorry of the abandoned cottage so you're going round in a circle
uh-huh
th-- the right-hand side go down right
see where they've they've got the chimney right
right see where that's s-- no
see where the chimney is on the abandoned cottage
right
right have you sto-- okay
stop about there
okay
have you got a fenced meadow on your le-- and about halfway up as well
you don't have a fenced meadow er
it's int-- half it's about halfway up the page and it's on the right the left-hand side of the page
halfway up
well
about a wee bit eh an angle down towards your left a wee bit i-- it's eh
right
go up
see where the chimney is right
sort of make about a forty-five degree angle towards for about about an inch
okay
an inch
did it go down d--
make an ang-- an angle to the bottom of that picture right going to your left
right
so you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage if you what i mean you're curving right round
right so
sort of right right where you've stopped right
at that curve it should be about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right
right
well can you make it make that curve
and then where you've stopped the curve sort of make a wide circle
eh have you got something between the a-- beside the abandoned cottage
to the right
mm ah so have i
i know where you are
so
do you know west lake is at the top
have you got a trig point
no you don't do you
have you got anything between west lake and abandoned cottage
nothing at all
uh-huh
i've got a me-- a fenced meadow but in the dire--
mmhmm
so
say the fenc-- say the fenced meadow's about halfway up
right
see where the abandoned cottage is
just down a wee bit right from that on the left
so you make sure you avoid that right round the very left-hand side the page sort of mark a bit so you avoid that
abandoned cottage about a
a centimetre uh-huh
uh-huh the very left uh-huh
right
see right where are you now at the bottom of the abandoned cottage
about an inch away
did you make a curve
right
i-- mark about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right and to your left mark about an inch away from that
right
a wee dot there
no can you mark a dot there
about an inch away from the abandoned cottage on the left-hand side make it make it about an inch right
and see where the roo-- you've the top of the roof is
your your curve make a make a cu-- a line from there to there
okay
right
see where the west lake is
brrrr see where ehm the very bottom curve of it is
can you make it like
see where you are now you're about an inch away from the abandoned cottage right
can you make a sort of a wide circle sort of a half circle towards the ehm bottom of that point that curve of west lake
right see where the "e" is in west lake
in lake
eh go r-- it's right underneath there
you know i'm talking about that point
where it starts to curve like it's to there eh you need a kind of wide ci-- a h-- half circle
eh but you're about an inch and a half away from the edge of the page
it's a fenced meadow
you're going above that
you're going above that
and you're about two inches away from the page
about a minute
the west lake is
mmhmm follow the curve of the west lake
right to oh aye to the ehm right
okay
nothing
there's nothing there either
well
that's what it is that's where the route is
okay
ehm
so you've curv-- and like you follow the curve of west lake
right
see where that see where i told you to go to stop at
uh-huh
you've got you're following to the to the right-hand side you're going right round the right-hand side see right see when you come to the right see right imagine you're at th-- the that point okay underneath the "e"
right
at west lake right we're at that corner go round right round the circle
then
uh-huh to the right
then up keep going up
'til you stop
uh-huh
'til you stop
where it starts you know where it starts eh sort of going sharply to the left in a straight line
stop there
at that point
uh-huh mmhmm so y--
uh-huh
right
see beside ehm see where you've stopped then right do you know where that sharp bit is i'm talking about
follow that bit up vertically right 'til it stops going vertically that's what i mean right
right
see where you've stopped
and how you can see a kind of a straight line it's almost a straight line
to your left in the west lake you know it goes folli-- it's sort of goes up vertically and it goes straight to your left well it goes up a bit
uh-huh
well
just where it stops going vertically right
can you see the monument
you do have a monument it's on the it's on the right-hand side it's to the right-hand side of the page about halfway up
right
see where you've stopped
draw a straight line in that in that in that angle
see where that that vertical see that ehm
that line on the west lake goes sh-- sharply up
dra-- draw eh that's it's that angle i'm talking about draw a straight line to the monument from there
mmhmm
on that angle
no
i take it you're going round the golf course
just draw a straight line
ah so it is
right
so where see the monument is
you're going underneath the monument and up
okay
you're curving round the monument
and go round underneath it
and curve round the bottom of it uh-huh
no
the west lake and the monument
i've got a p-- trig point
that's that's it's abou-- it's okay if you've gone right up towards that if you've gone right up
where the vertical bit is
see where the west lake is with the writing west lake
it's just about two inches away from that beside beside west lake
you should have curved over it if you had followed that curve west lake
you will right
and then you go straight it's a total straight line
going sloping downwards towards the monument
round the monument
just right round that
eh sort of right
are you at the of top the monument see the guy's head
right
stop about there okay curved above it
ehm you know the east lake is
just go vertically up there
fact
i'll tell you what would be even better
see the the guy's head on the monument the guy's hand sorry
where it's pointing right
so
go straight draw the line to you know where your fa--
see that curve that you're drawing round the monument
stop above his hand
right
uh-huh
right
and just c-- and go from there go straight up towards the east lake so you should be directly under the the "e" in lake
uh-huh
see the "e" in the word lake
the word "e"
in the lake right
see directly u-- underneath that on the on the coast line of that if you know what i mean the edge of it
make a dot there right
underneath the "e"
underneath the "e"
make a dot right beside the lake
and from the monument the guy's hand on the monument draw a line from that
okay
to the east lake and then just follow the curve of the east lake
so you follow the curve of the east lake to the left
sorry i've thought it was to the left
right
so eh
you know the bottom left of the east lake
about in a centimetre away from that keep drawing a line and then finish it
okay
see the "e" in the east
the letter the word east
underneath that draw a line about an inch away from that okay keep following the coast line
but don't don't go up don't go up vertically
you kn-- h-- just go straight along that except carry the line on
for about another centimetre
and just draw a cross
mmhmm
mmhmm
y-- but see where the east lake is see that that kind of line you followed
s-- of the lake
d-- you haven't gone up have you
'cause the line goes straight up you know how it goes vertically up
well
that's okay
that'll be it finished
