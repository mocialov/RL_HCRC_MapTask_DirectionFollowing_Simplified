okay right
i'm starting off from a-- above the caravan park
okay
right
and we're going to go and straight down south with the caravan park on your right-hand side
okay
and you're going to go down and then you're going to do a "u" shape
and we're going to come up and we're going to have the old
below what
picket fence
i don't have one so i would say
whereabouts is the picket fence
right okay well
you want to have the old mill on your right-hand side so if that fence is below the old mill you want to keep that on your right-hand side
okay
so you're going to come up and then you're going to come above the old mill and turn r--
old mill
mill you've only got a mill wheel
right okay
but continue past that
right
we've come down from a caravan park
and we're doing a "u" shape
okay on the and then you're going to proceed north right
no no
yeah
the caravan park is directly a-- above the the base of the "u"
right okay
and you're going to come up and the old mill well my old mill is going to be on the right so your mill wheel and the picket fence is going to be on the right-hand side
okay
so you come up to above the old mill
just above the old mill
and then turn right slightly sort of ten degrees or something and turn east
okay
so just eh
hombre
i don't have a forest
where's abouts the forest
below the abandoned cottage
okay
well you want to go round the outside of that you want to proceed to that east
right
from where you've got that forest
turn up north
with the forest on your left-hand side
yeah go below the forest yeah
and then turn and keep it on your left-hand side and the abandoned cottage
okay
and then when you get to the abandoned cottage do a slight sort of "c" shape
round the top of the abandoned cottage
okay
and then
yeah
uh-huh
right
and then
turn that "c" shape
right
so you're coming down come slightly down sort of south
southwest or just slightly
and then you're going to pass above a fenced meadow
do you have a fenced meadow
so you only have one fenced meadow
right okay
well just continue on that
right you've done that "c" shape right
and as if you're going to do a very wide "u" now
okay
and just ignore if you've not got a fenced meadow there then that's okay i do
right okay
right
but just do that "c" that "c"
yeah
and then
turn round and almost in a sort of big wide "u" and go back up again
and you're going to come up
and you're going to have a west lake
right
so you're going to almost follow the course of that right that west lake to the east the east side of it you're going to follow the c-- the course of it
yeah just at the base
and then follow the course of it round sort of a "u" an "s" shape
yeah
well
you've got a trig point do you have a trig point
no
right
so in between your west lake and the tri-- ah there's a trig point
right
so
you're going to do a sort of and just follow the contour of that lake round
okay
until you're almost at the top of the east hand coast
right
and then turn back round again in another sort of "c" or top of the "u"
right
and then you're going to come straight down at forty-five degrees
sort of southeast
right
you're going over the
no no no
you're staying well below that
so in between it would be in between farmed land and i have a trig point
right okay so it's just above the just at the just before the tip of that west lake but just at the east co-- just at that east coast
right
yeah
and come round so you're between you're well a good wee distance below that farmed land
okay
and then
you're going to come straight down at that forty-five degrees right
okay
and you're going to come to a monument
if you proceed straight down at like forty-five sort of an inverse
relationship line
okay
and then you come to that monument
and turn round that monument in a "u" shape
am--
yeah just
yeah
keeping the monument on your inside
okay
and then above the monument you have well i have a nuclear test site

yes so you're going to come between it
yeah slightly to the right of the monument
and above
right
and you're come up and then you've got the bottom of the east lake
and then follow that to the left
